# Introduction to tcutils

`tcutils` is a library of "helper" style functions for working with data in Clojure. If you are a data person used to working with tools like pandas or dplyr, you may miss some of the convenience and short-hand utility functions from these libraries when you try out Clojure's data science stack.

This library aims to fill this gap, helping you avoid having to re-implement utility functions or write verbose one-liners for very common operations in every project. Some of the functions have the same behaviour as similarly-named ones in other libraries, but some do not, so check out the docs to see what to expect.

This library is under active development and will grow in the coming months. To shape it's development and request certain features or functions, feel free to get in touch through any of the data science related channels on the Clojurian's [zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science) or [slack](http://clojurians.net) instances. To report issues, please open a [GitHub issue in the project's repo](https://github.com/scicloj/tcutils/issues).
